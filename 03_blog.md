I am currently a PhD candidate in the Angert Lab in the Botany Department and Biodiversity Research Centre at UBC. 

Before starting my PhD, I worked as a Research Assistant in a number of labs at the UBC Biodiversity Research Centre, including the Whitton, Germain, and Otto labs. 

I completed my Undergraduate thesis and Masters degree in the Department of Ecology and Evolutionary Biology with Marla Sokolwski at the University of Toronto.
