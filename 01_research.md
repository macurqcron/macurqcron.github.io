#### **Investigating spatial patterns of historical range expansion and mating system evolution**

In order to study genetic consequences of species geographic range expansion, it is important to resolve the historical pathways of range expansion. I am completing the phylogeography of <i>Erythranthe lewisii</i> to serve as a baseline for questions related to the genetic consequences of range expansion (e.g., decreased genetic variation, increased genetic load, mating system transitions, local adaptation). 
<p>
Selection for the evolution of reproductive assurance across a species’ geographic range can be driven by contemporary (e.g., pollinator-limitation) and historical processes (e.g., past range expansions). I will use my phylogeographic results as a framework to study spatial patterns in mating system evolution, and to investigate whether geographic variation in rates of selfing ability are driven the legacy of historical pathways of range expansion, including expansion after continental glacier retreat at the end of the Pleistocene epoch (20 000 years ago). 
 <p>
<i>Erythranthe lewisii</i> is a high-elevation riparian plant species with hermaphroditic flowers and a mixed-mating system capable of outcrossing and autonomous self-fertilization, is amenable to experimental manipulations in the greenhouse and field, as well as having many genomic resources available. Its native range spans the Coast, Cascade, and Rocky Mountain ranges and includes habitat that was both covered by the continental ice sheet and exposed during the last Ice Age, making it an ideal system to study the interaction between mating system evolution and historical range expansion.

#### **Demographic pathways of range expansion following primary succession**

Under changing climatic conditions, many species’ are shifting their distributions polewards and upslope, but recent eco-evolutionary models suggest that the process of range expansion may cause leading-edge populations to accumulate deleterious mutations. Before we can assess the genetic consequences of range expansion—and what they mean for the long-term fitness and persistence of edge populations under climate change—we need to understand the demographic pathways of range expansion. 
<p>
The colonization of newly exposed habitat following glacier retreat (e.g., primary succession) presents a unique opportunity to study the eco-evolutionary dynamics of range expansion. On shorter spatiotemporal scales, alpine glacier retreat since the end of the Little Ice Age (~150 ya) presents many parallel instances of range expansion along a gradient of terrain age at a single site (e.g., chronosequence). Although species colonization follows predictable patterns of diversity along alpine glacier forelands—habitat between the oldest terminal moraine and current glacier extent—the development of intraspecific patterns of genetic diversity has been understudied. 
 <p>
I am also using <i>Erythranthe lewisii</i> as a focal species to address this question along two glacier forelands in Garibaldi Provincial Park, BC.

#### **Effects of density-dependent selection during range expansion on the accumulation of expansion load**

Current models of expansion load only assess the effects of density-independent selection on relative reductions in edge population fitness. However, the demographic pathways or range expansion that facilitate allele surfing rely on decreasing gradients in population density during range expansion. 
<p>
 We propose to incorporate the effects of density-dependent selection during range expansion and assess its trait specific effects on the rate of allele surfing, deleterious mutation accumulation, and phenotypic expression of expansion load. We are using a combination of analytical and simulation based models to explore the effect of density-dependent selection on the accumulation of expansion load. Our goal is to explore a more nuanced set of assumptions underlying expansion load theory, and reflect processes occurring in natural range expansions that are currently not included in existing theoretical frameworks.

#### **Impacts of gender & career stage on grant writing and funding success**
This project aimed to investigate potential barriers to successful scientific funding outcomes for women and/or early career scientists. Using publicly available data from the NSERC Database, we explored interactions between gender and career stage on grant writing (word use) and funding success in the 2016 Discovery Grant competition. 
<p>
We did not detect significant influence of gender on word use or grant value, but we detected a strong main effect of career stage and gender across all NSERC categories on funding success. Career stage was the most important predictor of award value and rejection rates were higher for women (40 percent) than men (33 percent) at early career stages.
