In Summer 2018, I was about to start my first field season for my Ph.D. My fieldwork required me to go backpacking, for the first time in my life, to alpine habitat to document patterns of colonization of my focal study species following alpine glacier recession. My field assistant and I would be going on multiple 5-day-long trips, and we would be carrying all of our essentails plus field gear for demographic surveys. When I thought about what we would eat, I knew I would not be lugging cans of beans up the mountain in my pack which was already bound to be over 40 lbs. So, I took a deep dive into backpacking meal planning and preparation!  <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1zMHjh4XaILnjEm_SDvODWFKX34N6nJbqm7rBrKMSecQ/edit?usp=sharing" target="_blank"> This Google Doc is a summary of everything I learned along the way, plus my go-to recipes. </a> I hope it is helpful for other folks, whether backpacking for fieldwork or fun.
