In Summer 2018, I was about to start the first field season for my Ph.D. My fieldwork required me to go backpacking, for the first time in my life, to alpine habitat to document colonization of my focal study plant following alpine glacier recession. My field assistant and I would be going on 5 day trips, and we would be carrying all of our essentails plus field gear for demographic surveys. When I thought about what we would eat, I knew I would not be lugging cans of beans up the mountain in my pack which was already bound to be over 40 lbs. So, I took a deep dive into backpacking meal planning and preparation! This blog post is a summary of everything I learned along the way, plus my go-to recipes. I hope it is helpful for other folks, whether backpacking for fieldwork or fun.  

To add new posts, simply add a file in the `_posts` directory that follows the convention `YYYY-MM-DD-name-of-post.ext` and includes the necessary front matter. Take a look at the source for this post to get an idea about how it works.

Jekyll also offers powerful support for code snippets:

{% highlight ruby %}
def print_hi(name)
  puts "Hi, #{name}"
end
print_hi('Tom')
#=> prints 'Hi, Tom' to STDOUT.
{% endhighlight %}
